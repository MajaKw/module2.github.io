            Spacing: Pay attention to the spacing shown in the mockup illustrations. Note the spacing between sections
            (both horizontal and vertical). Note the horizontal spacing between the edges of the section and the edges
            of the browser window.
            Also, note the spacing between the dummy text in each section and the edges of the section. Lastly, make
            sure the dummy text is "pushed down"
            enough so it doesn't overlap the section title region.
